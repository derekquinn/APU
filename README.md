# Airport Pickup Utility (APU)

## Problem Description

This web application uses the Flight Stats and Google Distance matrix APIs to solve a common problem at airports far and wide. 

User enters a flight number, origin address and (optionally) a seat number to calculate the perfect departure time. 

George Costanza would have loved APU. His quote from Episode 52 of Seinfeld tells the whole story. 

### We're perfect. I timed this out so we would pull up at the terminal *exactly* 17 minutes after their flight is supposed to land. That gives them just enough time to get off the plane, pick up their bags and be walking *out* of the terminal as we roll up.

### I tell you, it's a thing of beauty. I can not express to you the feeling I get from a perfect airport pickup.
